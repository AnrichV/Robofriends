About this project
This is one of the apps I followed along with when doing the Fullstack development course from ZtM (https://zerotomastery.io/)
The goal of this excercise was to get aquainted React and Create React App.

This is a simple app made out of some containers and components also using https://robohash.org to generate images based on a user list from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
